      Hey there!  Welcome to my humble corner of the web.  I'm a Buffalo NY native but currently reside in sunny 
      St. Petersburg FL.  I enjoy adventures with my family where we can explore obscure destinations and wilderness 
      via bike, kayak, or Chuck Taylors.  You'll often find me upside-down as I do regular gymnastics training.

      As an IT consultant, I specialize in peeling back the layers of "unknown unknowns" to streamline operations, 
      cut costs, and drive innovation for businesses and government agencies. My journey here has been anything but 
      conventional, and it's this unique blend of experiences and skills that I believe can bring exceptional value to 
      those looking to transition their businesses into new, capable hands.

      Fresh out of high school I didn't know what I wanted to do professionally. I initially went to college for Political Science, then dabbled in odd-jobs like a maintenance mechanic at a milk factory and a host at a Chinese restaurant. After some time I decided I wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement so I went back to school for criminal justice. I wanted to find a security job to bolster my resume but ended up stumbling into the world of private investigations!

      I was the youngest detective that Phillip D. Smith and Associates had ever hired.  I mostly did insurance fraud, liability, and disability cases all over Western New York.  One day I'd be sleuthing in the inner-city, the next I'd be in some small town I'd never heard of.  By my estimates over a 4 year period my partner and I were responsible for over a quarter of a billion dollars saved for insurance companies, small business, and the State of New York.  It was a magnificent adventure, fraught with excitement and danger.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but constantly felt myself being drawn to other passions in my life.

      My first love was an Apple II E.  I was fascinated with the idea that typing words on a screen could essentially manifest anything, and wanted to learn as much as possible.  I started programming and web designing in middle school, and later worked on MEAN stack applications, Unity game development, and android SDK projects in my spare time.  I decided to hang up my digital audio recorder and mirror aviators to go back to school a third time.  I earned degrees in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems then moved to Florida to be closer to family.

      But life isn't all about bytes and bits.  In my spare time I work on elaborate carpentry projects. I've remodeled multiple properties and done everything from framing new walls, refinishing hardwood floors, and painting to installing fans, garbage disposals, and toilets.  I've also designed and built bunk beds, a shed, a playground, furniture, and more.  I'm a huge fan of using the right stain or finish to bring out the most in the wood I'm working with, and love pouring resin.  Other hobbies include reading philosophy & self-development books, listening to Alan Watts lectures, enthusiast PC building, go-karting, and drinking lots and lots of tea.

      As I look towards the future, my aim is to leverage this diverse background in technology and problem-solving to identify business acquisition opportunities where I can apply my skills and drive growth. For business owners contemplating the next chapter, I offer not just a transaction, but a partnership grounded in mutual respect, innovation, and a shared vision for success. Let's embark on this journey together, shaping a future that's as rewarding as it is exciting.
